* Studied mechanisms of biological and artificial intelligence in interdepartmental project at Samuel Gershman’s Lab.
* Calculated correlation in performance of 4-layer RNNs and 8 major language areas of the brain using Representational
Similarity Analysis.
* Parallelized computing tasks using MATLAB, bash scripting, and cluster computing.

## Projects

### The Opportunity Project: Ocean Plastics Sprint (ongoing)
* Conducted user research interviews to design end product. 
* Currently extracting and cleaning federal open source data to build visualizations and tools to help mitigate ocean plastics pollution. [Click here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alyssa.chen#!/vizhome/FishingGear/Sheet1?publish=yes) for a preview of what our team is working on! 

### The Education Epidemic: Visualizing the barriers to remote learning
* Extracted and cleaned data for visualizations from the U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) using Pandas. 
* Designed and wrote content for website. 
<br> [[live demo]](https://education-epidemic.github.io/home/) [[code]](https://github.com/eelegiap/hackmit2020) 

### Defining and Evaluating Fair Natural Language Generation
* Adapted individual fairness in classification to quantify fairness in natural language generation (NLG) models.
* Evaluated gender bias in GPT-2 and XLNet using novel fairness framework. <br>[[arXiV]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01548)

### Transfer Learning for Sketch Recognition with PyTorch
* Investigated performance of a pretrained VGG16 model on classification of 168 hand-drawn sketches from the TU-Berlin
dataset using PyTorch.
* Modified VGG16 using transfer learning techniques (eg. fixed feature extraction) to achieve higher validation accuracy on
sketches.<br>[[report]](https://alyssachen.me/files/pytorch.pdf) [[Google Colab]](https://github.com/alyssc/Neuro140/blob/master/Neuro140AlyssaChen.ipynb)
