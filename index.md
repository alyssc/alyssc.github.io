## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profpics/2b.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

I am a junior at Harvard studying Statistics. I'm broadly interested in data science and statistics applied to areas such as public health, public policy, psychology, and finance. I have previously worked in data science or data-related intern roles at Facebook, [Datavant](https://datavant.com/), and <a href = "https://secureailabs.com/" target = "_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>.
