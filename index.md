## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me2.jpg" style="width:170px;height:170px;">

Hi! I am a rising junior at Harvard studying applied mathematics, currently taking a semester off to pursue personal projects and <a href = "https://opportunityinsights.org/course/" target = "_blank"> self-paced courses</a>. This past summer, I worked as a data science intern at <a href = "https://secureailabs.com/" target = "_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>, a secure healthcare analytics startup in Cambridge, MA, where I worked on federated learning algorithms. Alongside academic explorations, I occasionally dabble in research through labs and coursework in the areas of machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and computational neuroscience. 

At Harvard, I am involved in <a href = "https://www.whrb.org/" target = "_blank"> WHRB</a>, Harvard's student-run radio station, where I currently organize remote programming as a Jazz department co-director. 

## Education

#### Selected Coursework 
Machine Learning (@MIT), Data Structures and Algorithms, Biological and Artificial Intelligence, Economics of Networks, Fairness and Validity in Algorithms (graduate), Group Theory, Probability, Statistical Inference, Theoretical Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Public Speaking Practicum, Physics: Mechanics and Special Relativity
