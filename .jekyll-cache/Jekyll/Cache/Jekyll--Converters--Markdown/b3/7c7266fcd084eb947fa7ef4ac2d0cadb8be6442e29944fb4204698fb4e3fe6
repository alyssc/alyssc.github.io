<p>I am a junior at Harvard studying Statistics. I’m broadly interested in data science and statistics applied to public health, government, and finance. I have previously worked at Facebook on the Instagram for Business team, <a href="https://datavant.com/">Datavant</a> on the <a href="https://covid19researchdatabase.org/">COVID-19 Research Database</a> team, and <a href="https://secureailabs.com/" target="_blank">Secure AI Labs</a> in data science or data-related intern roles.
