<p>I am a rising junior at Harvard studying applied mathematics, currently taking a semester off to work on projects and pursue self-paced courses. These days, I spend my time working under the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politicsâ€™ <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/steam" target="_blank">STEAM Program</a> and the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/sprints/" target="_blank"> Opportunity Project </a> to build technological tools and data visualizations to mitigate marine plastics pollution. This past summer, I worked on federated learning algorithms as a data science intern at <a href="https://secureailabs.com/" target="_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>, a secure healthcare analytics startup in Cambridge, MA. 
<br /><br />
At Harvard, alongside academic coursework, I dabble in research through labs and independently in the areas of machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and computational neuroscience. I also currently organize remote programming and events as a Jazz department co-director for <a href="https://www.whrb.org/" target="_blank"> WHRB</a>, Harvardâ€™s student-run radio station. 
<br /><br />
Contact me at <a href="mailto:alyssachen@college.harvard.edu">alyssachen@college.harvard.edu</a> to talk about my work or anything elseâ€”job opportunities, tech, social impact, philosophy, music, etc.</p>
