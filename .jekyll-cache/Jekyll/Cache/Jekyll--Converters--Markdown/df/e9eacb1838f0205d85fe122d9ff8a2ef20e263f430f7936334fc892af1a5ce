<p><img class="profile-picture" src="me2.jpg" style="width:170px;height:170px;" /></p>

<p>Hi! I am a rising junior at Harvard studying applied mathematics, currently taking a semester off to pursue personal projects and <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/course/" target="_blank"> self-paced courses</a>. This past summer, I worked as a data science intern at <a href="https://secureailabs.com/" target="_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>, a secure healthcare analytics startup in Cambridge, MA, where I worked on federated learning algorithms. Alongside academic explorations, I occasionally dabble in research through labs and coursework in the areas of machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and computational neuroscience.</p>

<p>At Harvard, I am involved in <a href="https://www.whrb.org/" target="_blank"> WHRB</a>, Harvard’s student-run radio station, where I currently organize remote programming as a Jazz department co-director.</p>
