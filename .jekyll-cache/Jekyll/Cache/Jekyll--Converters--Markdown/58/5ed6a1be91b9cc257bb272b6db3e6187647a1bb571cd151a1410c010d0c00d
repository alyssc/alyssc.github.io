<p>Hi! I am a rising junior at Harvard studying applied mathematics, currently taking a semester off to pursue personal projects and <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/course/" target="_blank"> self-paced courses</a>. This past summer, I worked on federated learning algorithms as a data science intern at <a href="https://secureailabs.com/" target="_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>, a secure healthcare analytics startup in Cambridge, MA. Alongside academic explorations, I occasionally dabble in research through labs and coursework in the areas of machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and computational neuroscience. 
<br /><br />
I currently organize remote programming and events as a Jazz department co-director for <a href="https://www.whrb.org/" target="_blank"> WHRB</a>, Harvard’s student-run radio station. 
<br /><br />
Contact me at <a href="mailto:alyssachen@college.harvard.edu">alyssachen@college.harvard.edu</a> to talk about my projects and experience or anything else—job opportunities, tech, social impact, philosophy, music, poetry, etc.</p>
