<p>I am a rising junior at Harvard currently on a gap year. These days, I work at <a href="https://datavant.com/">Datavant</a> on the <a href="https://covid19researchdatabase.org/">COVID-19 Research Database</a> team to help researchers use real world health data to understand issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. I previously worked on federated learning algorithms as a data science intern at <a href="https://secureailabs.com/" target="_blank">Secure AI Labs</a>, a secure healthcare analytics startup in Cambridge, MA. 
<br /><br />
At Harvard, alongside academic coursework, I dabbled in research through labs and independently in the areas of machine learning, algorithmic fairness, and computational neuroscience. I also currently organize remote programming as a Jazz department co-director for <a href="https://www.whrb.org/" target="_blank"> WHRB</a>, Harvardâ€™s student-run radio station. 
<br /><br />
Contact me at <a href="mailto:alyssachen@college.harvard.edu">alyssachen@college.harvard.edu</a> to talk about my work or anything elseâ€”data, social impact, healthcare, philosophy, music, etc.</p>
